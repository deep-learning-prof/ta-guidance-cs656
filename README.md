# Guide for Teaching Assistants. 

This objective of this guide is to give you concise tasks that need to be completed as part of your TA
duties. 

Your responsibility as a TA is to run the logistics of the course and grade assignments. The
logistics of the course include organizing the course page, building a schedule of assignments,
posting assignments and their instructions, posting announcements, and deploying virtual
machines. 

This guide provides an overview of the tasks. Specific steps for some of the tasks can be found in this
repo.  

## Course webpage organization tasks
The course page is hosted on Microsoft Teams as a "team" page. The team page is composed of
channels and each channel is formed by tabs. The channels in this course correspond to a topic and they
usually have a `Posts`, a `Files`, and a `Video` tab. Some channels may have additional tabs to display more resources for the students.

*The main task to be completed to organize course page is to copy the contents from the
previous semester Teams page to the current semester's page.*  

To illustrate the organization tasks for the channels and their tabs in this course,
we will use the `02-Symmetric Cryptography` channel in CS 656 as an example. 

### Example: The `02-Symmetric Cryptography` Channel
This channel covers the topic of symmetric cryptography. It has five videos covering 5 different topics.
Each video has a corresponding set of slides. The topics are illustrated with a lab. The students can
test their knowledge with a set of homework problems.

The channel includes a `Posts`, a `Files`, and a `Video` tab. 

#### The `Files` tab
The `Files` tab contains three folders: `Slides`, `Lab`, and `Homework`. As expected, the `Slides` folder
contains the slides for each of the five videos, the `Lab` tab contains the instructions for the lab, and
the `Homework` folder contains the homework problems.  

The contents for the three folders have already been developed. However, they are not automatically
copied when the new Teams page is created. 

**Your responsibility as a TA is to ensure that the folders in the tabs are filled with the correct
files** 

Specific steps to copy the files from a previous course to the current one are provided in a separate
guide. 

#### The `Videos` tab
The videos tab contains 5 videos.  Similarly to the `Files` tab, the video tab is not automatically
generated when create the new Teams page. 

**Your responsibility is to create the videos tab with the correct videos**

Specific steps to copy the files from a previous course to the current one are provided in a separate
guide.

#### The `Posts` tab
The `Posts` tab is automatically populated when an assignment is posted. The main use of this tab is to
provide updates to the assignments by replying with a comment. We will cover student communications in a
different section.  


## Lab Schedule Building
Setting a schedule early in the semester helps students (and TA/instructors) to plan ahead. The schedule
of labs is constrained by the following

* The semester start/end dates, holidays, exams, and unforeseen situations. 
* Students should have at least one week to complete the lab. 
* Students should only be working on one lab at a time. 
* Students should receive their lab grade no later than two weeks from submission.  

**Your responsibility is to set the submission date for all the labs in the semester in consulation with
the instructor**

Here, "in consultation with the instructor" means that you will seek approval from the instructor before
posting any dates to the course page.

**Tip**: Use the previous semester's schedule as a template to build the schedule. 

## Lab Assignment Creation
For students to be able to submit their lab report, we need to create an assignment within the course
page. The assignment should at the minimum contain the following:

* A message indicating where they can find the instructions for the lab. 
* A due date (which is set by your lab schedule above) 
* A close date after which we will no longer accept submissions. We set a close date to prevent the TA
  from having to grade labs from many weeks in the past. 
* The lab assignment should be posted to the corresponding channel. 

**Your responsibility is to create the lab assignment for all the labs in the course**

## Virtual Machine Deployment
The labs in this course are conducted on vApps (i.e., a collection of VMs) hosted on the Dakota State University's
servers. Each student receives their own vApps for each lab. The vApps for each lab have already been
created by the instructor. To deploy a vApp, the TA must complete the following steps:

* Identify the vApp template from the previous semester on the DSU server. 
* Open the vApp ensure that the required files, including lab instructions, and lab code, are stored in
  the vApp.
* Upload/replace any files that are missing or outdated.
* Log out of Teams and any other service you logged in. 
* Remove all cookies, the web cache, terminal history, and any other personal information you may havet
  left in the vApp. 
* Close the vApp
* Create a template and give it a descriptive name. 
* Send an email to Eric Holm (`eric.holm [at] dsu.edu`) requesting that the vApp is deployed for
  students. 

A guide with more specific steps can be found on this repo. 

**Your responsibility is to deploy the class vApps on time (i.e., so that students have at least one full
week to work on the lab) for all the lab assignments in the class**

## Weekly Announcement Posting
To better guide students during the course, we need to give them specific tasks to complete every week. 
We do this through a weekly announcement on the course page. The announcement should include the
following:

* The announcement should start with the course tag, i.e., `@[the name of the course]` to
  ensure that all students receive a notification about the annoucement. 
* The announcement's first sentence should be a friendly greeting. 
* A brief summary of the importance of the topic and the sub-topics
  that will be covered. 
* A list of tasks to be completed during the week. 
* A closing statement saying they can contact the TA/instructor with questions. 

**Your responsibility is to send the weekly statement on the first business day of the every week of the
semester**

Note that the annoucements can be written and then scheduled to be posted in the future. 

Note that you can reuse announcements (with corresponding edits) from previous semesters.

You may also use AI tools such as ChatGPT to generate announcements as long as you verify their accuracy
and make any necessary edits before posting.
