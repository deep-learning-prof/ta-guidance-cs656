# Guidance for Teaching Assistants 

This repo contains various guides to help you complete all your TA duties. On the first day of classes,
read the `getting-started.md` document. Starting on the second week of classes, you can follow the
`weekly-checklist.md` document to make sure you don't miss anything. Additional instructions
for specific tasks can be found in the rest of the repo.
