# Copying files between courses

The files that need to be copied into the `Files` tab of each channel of the couse can be copied from the
previous semester's page. This guide gives a step by step guide on how to do this. 

## Preparation
Teams does not create the folder the channel until we access the channel. So, the first step is to
identify the channel in the target team, and navigate to its `Files` tab. 

## Method 1: Use the Teams file manager

This method allows you to copy folders between two "teams" within Microsoft Teams without leaving the
Teams application. 

* Open the Teams application
* Ensure that the source and target teams are available. The source team is the previous semester's  
  team. The target team is the current semester's team.  
* Determine the channel for which you want to copy the files. 
* Open the source team. 
* Navigate to the corresponding channel 
* Open the `Files` tab. 
* Select the folders/files you would like to copy
* Cllick on the three dots of any of the selected files. 
* Select `Copy to`. A new window should open. 
* Select the target team on the list of teams on the left column under Quick Access. 
    * If you don't see the target team. Click on `More places...`. This will open all your teams. Select
      the target team. 
* Once you open the files of the target team, navigate to the channel. You can do this by
  clicking on `In channels` and then the corresponding channel. 
* Click the `Copy here` button. 
* Open the channel in the target team. Navigate to the corresponding channel. Open the `Files` tab.
* Verify that you copied the files to the right folder. Note that it may take a couple minutes for all
  files to get copied. 


## Method 2: Use the SharePoint website. 
If the first method fails, or if you simply prefer something else, you can use the Sharepoint website. 

* Open the Teams application
* Ensure that the source and target teams are available. The source team is the previous semester's  
  team. The target team is the current semester's team.  
* Determine the channel for which you want to copy the files. 
* Open the source team. 
* Navigate to the corresponding channel 
* Open the `Files` tab. 
    * Do not select any files at this point.
* Click on three dots next to the `Download` button on the top menu. 
* Click on `Open in SharePoint` on the dropdown menu. This will open a browser tab. 
* Follow the same steps as above.

## Change the channel permissions
Students should not be able to edit the `Files` tab. To change the channel permission, 
follow these steps. 

* Open the team page
* Navigate to the `Files` tab of any channel
* Open SharePoint on a browser window by clicking on the three dots on the top menu and then `Open in
  SharePoint`.
* Click on the `Documents` tab next to the name of the channel. 
* Select the corresponding channel
* Click on the three dots next to the name of the channel
* Select `Manage Access`
* By default teams gives members edit permissions. Only the team members should have edit permissions. 
* Change the permissions for the team visitors and team members to `Can View`
